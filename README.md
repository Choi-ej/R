### sasUnivariate.R
To output the same statistical information as when using the 'univariate' function in SAS within R, the following information is printed:
- Data mean, standard deviation, variance, etc.
- Median, quartiles, maximum, and minimum values
- Outliers
- Several visualizations to aid in understanding the distribution's shape.
